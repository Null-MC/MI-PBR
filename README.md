# MI-PBR
A minimal PBR resource pack for the Modern Industrialization mod. This project is still an early work-in-progress so not all blocks are complete.

## Releases
You can find them under _Assets_ in the [Releases](https://github.com/Null-MC/MI-PBR/releases) section.
- The "LabPBR" version is preferred, more modern, and more feature-complete.
- The OldPBR version is for shaders that do not support LabPBR, like SEUS.
